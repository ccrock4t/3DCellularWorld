# 3DCellularWorld

A simulator game where you can create and edit 3D cellular automaton voxel worlds using various elements.

This type of simulator is sometimes referred to as a 3d "falling sand simulator". This one is implemented using cellular automata for the benefits of parallelization.

# Requirements
Built with Unity.

You may select to run the algorithm on either your CPU or your GPU. The two versions look different: the CPU version renders meshes of voxels which are then drawn on the camera, whereas the GPU version directly draws the relevant voxel color for each camera pixel.

This project was started in Summer 2022 as an extension of the Udemy Minecraft Voxel World course: [https://www.udemy.com/course/unityminecraft/learn/lecture/28605694#overview ](https://www.udemy.com/course/unityminecraft/)

It was completed in Fall 2022, and released in Fall 2023 along with a technical report.
